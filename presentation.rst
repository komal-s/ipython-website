**Presentations Using IPython**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


We have given a number of talks and presentations about IPython:

----------
  2010 
----------
 * `Slides <http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/About/Presentations?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=ipython_scipy10_india.pdf>`_ from a talk that Fernando Perez presented at the `SciPy India 2010 conference <http://scipy.in/scipyin/2010>`_.
 * Brian Granger has written a `whitepaper <http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/About/Presentations?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=ipython_winhpc_whitepaper_v1.pdf>`_ describing the new support that ipcluster has for Windows HPC Server 2008. If you use IPython's parallel computing architecture on Windows, this provides a very nice way of starting the controller and engines on a cluster.  The whitepaper shows how to get started with IPython and Windows HPC Server 2008 as well two examples of using IPython to perform an interactive parallel computation. This material is also in our documentation `here <http://ipython.scipy.org/doc/nightly/html/parallel/parallel_winhpc.html>`_ and `here <http://ipython.scipy.org/doc/nightly/html/parallel/parallel_demos.html here>`_. Many thanks to Microsoft for funding Brian Granger to work on this.

  2009 
--------
 * At `SciPy '09 <http://conference.scipy.org/>`_, we had a `lightning talk <https://cirl.berkeley.edu/fperez/talks/0908_scipy_state_ipython.pdf>`_ on the state of IPython.
 * At the `IAM CSE09 conference <http://www.siam.org/meetings/cse09/>`_ we gave two presentations about IPython: a `general one <http://ipython.scipy.org/talks/0903_siamcse09_ipython_interact_fperez.pdf>`_ and another focused on `parallel and distributed computing <http://ipython.scipy.org/talks/0903_siamcse09_ipython_dist_bgranger.pdf>`_.  If you are interested, the slides from all the presentations at this meeting `are available <https://cirl.berkeley.edu/fperez/py4science/2009_siam_cse/>`_.

---------
  2008 
---------
 * A `talk <http://ipython.scipy.org/talks/0809_23andme_ipython.pdf>`_ at `23andMe <http://23andme.com>`_ where I spoke about ipython in general, with some details about its facilities for distributed computing. 

---------
  2007 
---------
 * `Slides <http://ipython.scipy.org/doc/talks/0712_pit_architecture.pdf>`_ from Dave Hudak, from the Ohio Supercomputing Center, about a ''proposed'' system using IPython for high-level, fully managed access to supercomputing resources (this system hasn't been implemented yet as of Sept 2008).
 * An `article about IPython <http://amath.colorado.edu/faculty/fperez/preprints/ipython-cise-final.pdf>`_, written by Fernando Perez and Brian Granger, published in the `May/June 2007 issue <http://cise.aip.org/dbt/dbt.jsp?KEY=CSENFA&Volume=9&Issue=3>`_ of the journal ''Computing in Science and Engineering''.
 * A `set of slides <http://ipython.scipy.org/talks/Trilinos-IPython.pdf>`_ by Bill Spotz, from Sandia National Labs, on using IPython to interactively use the `Trilinos <http://trilinos.sandia.gov/>`_ parallel solvers.
 * Two `talks <http://ipython.scipy.org/talks/0702_pycon/>`_ about IPython at `PyCon2007 <http://us.pycon.org/TX2007/HomePage>`_ (see the demos and movies as well).
 * A `talk <http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/About/Presentations?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=ipython_msri07.pdf>`_ at an `Interactive Parallel Computation in Support of Research in Algebra, Geometry and Number Theory <http://www.msri.org/ MSRI]/Berkeley workshop on [http://www.msri.org/calendar/workshops/WorkshopInfo/410/show_workshop>`_.

---------
  2006 
---------
 * `Slides <http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/About/Presentations?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=ipython_cu06.pdf>`_ of a talk entitled "Interactive Parallel Computing with Python and IPython," at CU Boulder.
 * A `poster <http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/About/Presentations?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=ipython_DANSE06.pdf>`_ as the `DANSE kickoff meeting <http://www.cacr.caltech.edu/projects/danse/meetings/kickoff/>`_.
 * A `lightening talk <http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/About/Presentations?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=ipython_scipy06.pdf>`_ at `SciPy'06 <http://www.scipy.org/SciPy2006>`_ about the Parallel Computing capabilities of IPython.
 * `Slides <http://modular.ucsd.edu/sage/days1/perez.pdf>`_ and `MP3 audio <http://modular.ucsd.edu/sage/days1/audio/day1/voice004.mp3>`_ of a talk at `SAGE Days 2006 <http://modular.ucsd.edu/sage/days1/index.html>`_.
 * A `poster <http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/About/Presentations?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=ipython_SIAMpp06.pdf>`_ presented at `SIAM's Parallel Processing '06 conference <http://www.siam.org/meetings/pp06/>`_.
