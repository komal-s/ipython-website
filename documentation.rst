Our `About/Presentations <http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/About/Presentations>`_ page contains most of the talks we've given at various venues regarding IPython over the years.

 Videos and screencasts 
========================

 * Brian Granger has a number of screencasts on his `YouTube channel <http://www.youtube.com/user/ellisonbg>`_ about using IPython's parallel computing capabilities. These include a number of examples and a guide to getting started with IPython and Windows HPC Server 2008. Two of `these <http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/The+HPC+Show/Open-source-HPC-code-Episode-11-IPython-Grid-Engine-running-on-Windows-HPC-Server-2008/>`_ `videos <http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/The+HPC+Show/Open-source-HPC-code-Episode-12-IPython-computes-150-million-digits-of-Pi-in-Parallel/>`_ are also being hosted on Microsoft's channel 9.
 * The `ShowMeDo <http://showmedo.com>`_ site contains instructional videos on a number of topics.  `[:ShowMeDo:This page] <http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/ShowMeDo>`_(from our own wiki) contains further information on ideas for new IPython-related videos.
 * Jose Unpingco has created a set of screencasts on using the Vision/IPython combo for parallel computing.  They are available both at the `Ohio Supercomputer Center's user site <https://www.osc.edu/cms/sip/node/17>`_  and at `ShowMeDo <http://showmedo.com/videotutorials/series?name=XCsI4bsup>`_.
 * Another series by Jose Unpingco makes up a tutorial on IPython with a focus on scientific computing, which also include a lot of useful tips on Windows setup and configuration.  This series is also available both at the `OSC user site <https://www.osc.edu/cms/sip/>`_ and at `ShowMeDo <http://showmedo.com/videotutorials/series?name=N49qyIFOh>`_.
 * A new  `5-part series <http://showmedo.com/videos/series?name=CnluURUTV>`_ by Jeff Rush, approximately 1 hour long.  Jeff uses a working IPython to show many features.  Created 2007.  "...but I have to say that I loved the videos. And honestly, I (re)learned a few tricks along the way!..." - Fernando Perez.
 * A new `5-minute slideshow overview <http://showmedo.com/videos/video?name=980000&fromSeriesID=98>`_ by Jeff Rush entitled "Python and the Interactive Shell 'IPython'".  Created 2007.
 * A set `of 4 videos <http://showmedo.com/videos/series?name=PythonIPythonSeries>`_ by Ian Ozsvald showing various aspects of IPython.  Created 2006.

 External Documentation, Related Presentations and Tutorials 
=============================================================
This is a collection of presentations, often by authors outside of the core IPython team.  Some are focused on aspects of IPython itself while others may be about external projects that use IPython as a key component.  If you have any material that fits this description, please contact the IPython team and let us know about it so we can post it here.

 * The `BCPy2000 project <http://bci2000.org/downloads/BCPy2000/About.html>`_ offers Python tools for Brain-Computer interface development, and it uses IPython in a really neat way to enable interactive debugging of all the components as they operate in real-time. `This talk <http://videolectures.net/mloss08_hill_bcpy/>`_ presented at the 2008 NIPS conference shows the system.
 * `Jose Unpingco <http://www.osc.edu/~unpingco>`_ made this really neat `screencast <http://www.osc.edu/~unpingco/Tutorial_11Dec.html>`_ showing how to couple IPython's parallel capabilities with the `Vision <http://mgltools.scripps.edu>`_ environment.  Vision is an extremely impressive visual programming environment developed by `Michel Sanner's <http://www.scripps.edu/~sanner>`_ team at the Scripps Institute in La Jolla, CA.
 * An  `article <http://www.redhatmagazine.com/2008/02/07/python-for-bash-scripters-a-well-kept-secret>`_ by Noah Gift on RedHat Magazine that covers using Python, and IPython, as a better Bash.
 * An `article <http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-netsnmpnipython>`_ by Noah Gift at the IBM Developer Works site, on using the Net-SNMP library to interactively explore and manage a network (the interactive part courtesy of IPython, of course).
 * A `post and video <http://blog.boucault.net/post/2007/12/10/IPython-and-Pigment-simplicity>`_ about using IPython's GTK support to interactively control a `Pigment <https://code.fluendo.com/pigment/trac>`_ application.  It also uses the IPython demo class.
 * A `set of slides <http://www.python-industries.com/clepy/ipython/>`_ introducing IPython and summarizing its features.  A good introduction for the newcomer, and even experienced users may find things there they didn't know about.
 * An `article <http://www.linux.com/archive/feature/47635>`_ at Linux.com about IPython, by Conrad Koziol.
 * An `article <http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/python/2005/01/27/ipython.html>`_ by Jeremy Jones at ONLamp.com, introducing IPython to new users and giving a tour of its features as a replacement for the default Python shell.
 * The O'Reilly book `Python for Unix and Linux System Administration <http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596515829/>`_ has a chapter (the first, and largest one) on IPython. IPython is also used throughout the book to illustrate other Python technologies.

`Here <http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/About/>`_ Projects_Using_IPython you can find a list of projects that use IPython in one form or another.  If you use IPython as part of a project, please do add your information to this page or email `Fernando.Perez@Berkeley.edu <Fernando.Perez@Berkeley.edu>`_ and I'll be happy to add it.
