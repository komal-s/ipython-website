**IPython: An Interactive Computing Environment** 
=================================================

The goal of IPython is to create a comprehensive environment for
interactive and exploratory computing.  To support, this goal, IPython
has two main components:

	- An enhanced interactive Python shell.
	- An architecture for interactive parallerel computing.

All of IPython is open source (released under the revised BSD license).  You can see what projects are using IPython `here <project.html>`_, or check out the `talks and presentations <presentation.html>`_ we have given about IPython.  

IPython supports Python 2.5 and 2.6 officially.  If you need to use Python 2.4, the 0.10 series probably works OK but has not been extensively tested with 2.4.

An ''experimental'' Python3 port has been started recently.  The code is currently only available  `in source form from github <http://github.com/ipython/ipython-py3k>`_ but we welcome testing, contributions and improvements.  Please join the `IPython developers list <http://mail.scipy.org/mailman/listinfo/ipython-dev>`_ to participate!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 **Citing IPython** 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Several of the authors of IPython are connected with academic and scientific research, so it is important to us to be able to show the impact of our work in other projects and fields.

If IPython contributes to a project that leads to a scientific publication, please acknowledge this fact by citing the project, you can see `CitingIPython <citing.html>`_ for a ready-made citation entry.  We have a listing of `projects using IPython <project.html>`_, for which updates are always also welcome.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 **Announcements** 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - '''Development Version:''' what will be 0.11 is taking shape, but lots of changes are coming (including some that break compatibility).  We would like your feedback, from either the `nightly documentation <http://ipython.scipy.org/doc/nightly/html/whatsnew/development.html>`_ or `source tarball <http://github.com/ipython/ipython/tarball/master>`_ (you can also follow the trunk from `GitHub <http://github.com/ipython/ipython>`_).
 - '''Current Version:''' 0.10.1, released on October 11, 2010.
 - '''Previous Version:''' 0.10, released on August 4, 2009.


More news about IPython can be found `here <news.html>`_.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 **Download** 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you just want to grab IPython, this `page <download.html>`_ has direct links to downloads of the latest version in various formats, and you can always access the download directory with all previous versions `here <download.html>`_.


Or, for those who prefer the bleeding edge, the development version of IPython can be downloaded from our `GitHub repository <http://github.com/ipython/ipython>`_ using `Git <http://git-scm.com>`_:

Please note that currently, the IPython trunk is undergoing significant changes and APIs are changing.  So unless you keep tabs on the development mailing list, you may find a few surprises if you update from our GitHub sources frequently.

*git clone git://github.com/ipython/ipython.git*   


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 **Documentation** 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`This page <documentation.html>`_ has links to all of IPython's documentation.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 **Mailing Lists** 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The easiest way to get your questions about IPython answered is to ask on our mailing lists. Please note that these do ''not'' allow non-subscribers to post, because of the inordinate amount of spam that is otherwise generated.

 -  `Users <http://projects.scipy.org/mailman/listinfo/ipython-user>`_ mailing list
 -  `Developers <http://projects.scipy.org/mailman/listinfo/ipython-dev>`_ mailing list

A gmane news gateway provides web mirrors of these lists (`users <http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.ipython.user>`_ and `developers <http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.ipython.devel>`_).


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 **Report Bugs** 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We want IPython to be as bug-free as possible, so we encourage our users to `report <http://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues>`_ all bugs they find, as well as important feature requests (those should be marked as "Wishlist" items).


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 **PyReadline** 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Under Windows, IPython requires an additional module to support color, tab completion and other features. These are provided by the `PyReadline <pyreadline.html>`_ project, also hosted on this site.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 **Hosting** 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
IPython has been generously hosted by `Enthought <http://enthought.com/>`_ almost since its inception.  We also use `GitHub <http://github.com/>`_ and `Git <http://git-scm.com/>`_ for code hosting and distributed version control.
