Here is a brief list of other projects using IPython.  If you know of more, feel free to add them, and if IPython contributes to a publication, please see Self:CitingIPython for a citation entry.

================
Scientific computing projects 
================
 * The `JModelica <http://www.jmodelica.org>`_ system for dynamical systems simulation and modeling uses IPython and matplotlib for its interactive analysis and visualization.
 * The University of Colorado's Mechanical Engineering Department, as part of the Denver Aerosol Sources and Health (DASH) study,  `uses IPython <http://www.microsoft.com/casestudies/Case_Study_Detail.aspx?CaseStudyID=4000007661>`_ to parallelize the data analysis.
 * The Sardana system, part of the `uses IPython <http://www.esrf.eu European Synchrotron Radiation Facility>`_.
 * `ASCEND <http://ascend.cheme.cmu.edu/>`_  embeds an IPython shell in its PyGTK GUI, using code from the Accerciser project. `More details <http://ascendwiki.cheme.cmu.edu/Python_console_support>`_.
 * `PyIMSL Studio <http://www.vni.com/products/imsl/pyimslstudio/overview.php>`_, by Visual Numerics, is a set of tools that expose the classic IMSL numerical libraries to Python, and ships with IPython, NumPy, SciPy and matplotlib as the core Python environment.
 * The `Trilinos <http://trilinos.sandia.gov>`_  project has Python bindings that can be used effectively via IPython, see `these slides <http://ipython.scipy.org/talks/Trilinos-IPython.pdf>`_ for details.
 * The `PyRAF <http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/pyraf>`_  environment for astronomical image analysis, from the `Space Telescope Science Institute <http://www.stsci.edu/>`_ , will include in its next official release an IPython-based interface.  Currently (May'05) this functionality is only available via SVN PyRAF.
 * The `CASA interactive shell <http://casa.nrao.edu/demo1.shtml>`_  from the National Radio Astronomy Observatory is built on top of IPython.
 * The `Ganga <http://ganga.web.cern.ch/ganga>`_  system, developed at CERN for Grid job control for the `LHCb <http://lhcb.web.cern.ch/lhcb>`_ and `ATLAS <http://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/index.html>`_ experiments, uses IPython for its `CLIP interface <http://ganga.web.cern.ch/ganga/user/v4/CLIP>`_.
 * `SAGE <http://www.sagemath.org/>`_, a system for algebraic number theory and arithmetic geometry, uses IPython for its interactive command-line interface.
 * `Singular <http://www.singular.uni-kl.de/>`_, another computer algebra system, also offers an IPython interface (Singular is also accessible as a SAGE subsystem).
 * The `Pymerase <http://pymerase.sourceforge.net/>`_ project for microarray gene expression databases, exposes an IPython shell in its iPymerase mode.
 * The [:PyMAD: PyMAD] project, where IPython is used to control a neutron spectrometer at the CEA-Grenoble and the Institut Laue Langevin in France.  A `Wiki <http://projects.scipy.org/ipython/ipython/wiki/NewDesign/API>`_ is available detailing some of the new features introduced in IPython to support PyMAD (as well as PyRAF).  This may be of interest to those who wish to embed IPython in complex environments.

 
 
====================
 Web frameworks and other systems 
====================
 
 * The `pitz <http://pitz.tplus1.com/>`_ distributed task/bug tracking system.
 * Nicolas Rougier implemented a  `pyglet Python terminal <http://www.loria.fr/~rougier/pyglet-terminal.html>`_ that can optionally use IPython.
 * The `Pylons <http://pylonshq.com/>`_ web framework can optionally use IPython if installed.
 * As of Jan'06 (`Changeset 1930 <http://code.djangoproject.com/changeset/1930>`_, to be precise), IPython is the admin shell for the `Django <http://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ web framework.
 * You can use IPython to debug Zope and Plone, as explained in `these <http://michaelthornhill.blogspot.com/2005/08/team-development-with-plone-zope-zeo.html>`_  `two <http://michaelthornhill.blogspot.com/2005/09/how-to-debug-zopeplone-with-ide.html>`_  pages.
 * The `database can be <http://schevo.org/ Schevo>`_ `explored with IPython <http://orbtech.com/blog/schevo/got-ipython>`_.
 * The  `Axon Shell <http://kamaelia.sourceforge.net/AxonShell.html>`_ in the BBC's Kamaelia project is an embedded IPython instance.
 * As of revision 53 (Oct 11/05), the new  `Turbo Gears <http://www.turbogears.org/>`_ framework can optionally use IPython as its shell.   `This post <http://www.twistedrails.org/blog/2005/11/13/editing-modelpy-from-ipython-via-tg-admin-shell/>`_ has some details on how it works.
 * `Movable Python <http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/movpy>`_, by Michael Foord and Bruno Thoorens, is a way of building portable Python environments which uses IPython for its interactive features.
 * The  `Logix <http://livelogix.net/logix>`_ programming system integrates with IPython for interactive work.
 * The `iVR toolkit <http://visualisation.tudelft.nl/Projects/iVR>`_ provides IPython as its shell in interactive Virtual Reality applications.
